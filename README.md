# Europe's_Countrys

Countries of Europe is a game I developed for children to learn the names of the countries that belong to Europe.
To create project I used basic knowledge of Python, object-oriented programming and pandas library.

After downloading and launching the game from a terminal or from the chosen IDE, you have to list all the countries of Europe that you know.
After entering the correct name, it will be assigned to the appropriate place on the map of Europe. To quit the game, type 'exit' in the answer field. 
Closing the game will generate or overwrite a text file with the names of the countries you still need to learn.
